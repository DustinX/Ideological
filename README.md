# Ideological.io
Ideological is a Node.js based application intended to fight against fake news. While a more connected world has it's benefits, one downside is that people have come to rely on social media to consume news. Social media's ability to broadcast to a large base is undeniable. However, no one seems to question the validity behind these "posts" or "tweets". If the 2016 election proved anything, it's that "fake news" is being spread using these outlets at an alarming degree. So much so, that Facebook has invested in creating a solution to the problem. Simply put, it's on everyone to check articles for sources and make sure to flag articles that don't pass the lithmus test.

## Premise
Ideological leverages the "News API" to pull up to date news. These articles are available to be read by anyone, but one must become a user to rate the article's validity and bias. The hope is that by removing the network affiliation from the article, that people would be more willing to read articles that don't necesarily align with their political views as well as check their preconcieved notions at the door. 

## Goals
Ideological at this moment relies on user's input to determine the "truthyness" of an article. This is simply the first step. The hope is that Ideologica will grow to become an AI that is able to not only validate an article, but caution users who are about to read unsubstantiated articles.
